          You may be having difficulty accessing the <em>vulnerable parts</em> of yourself. If you feel as though there are aspects of your life that are at odds with each other. You may struggle to know what needs to shift. Whether you're dealing with anxiety, difficulties in relationships, or feeling stuck in old patterns, therapy can be a place to <em>slow down and get real</em>â€”with yourself, your feelings, and the things you want to change.

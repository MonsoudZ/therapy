          I'm Angela Keeley, a therapist who specializes in helping people access more <em>safety, connection and pleasure</em> in their lives. My approach blends traditional and cutting-edge modalities to help clients navigate stuck patterns, relationships, and personal growth with more ease and authenticity.

        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          I believe therapy should be a place where you get to feel <em>seen, supported, and empowered</em>. Whether you're seeking relief from painful past experiences, struggling in your relationships, or looking for a therapist who isn't afraid to talk about the hard stuff, I welcome you as you are.

        Reaching out to a therapist can feel <em>terrifying</em>. The idea of sitting down with a stranger and opening up about the hardest parts of your life? It makes total sense if that feels overwhelming or even impossible. You might be wondering,

          <p>
            I didn't always know I wanted to be a therapist. Like many of us, I took some detours,
            had some "what am I doing with my life?" moments, and eventually found my way here.
          </p>
          <p>
            What drew me to this work? The simple truth that we all have stories worth telling,
            pain worth healing, and growth worth pursuing. I've seen firsthand how the right
            support can transform someone's entire world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I get to spend my days helping people untangle their thoughts, process their
            experiences, and build the kind of life that actually feels good to live.

          <p>
            I specialize in working with folks who feel this way. I welcome all the things about you and your experiences that make you unique and brought you to where you are today. There are some parts you may be immensely proud of, and other things you may spend a lot of energy trying to hide. <em>I welcome all of you here.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I blend evidence-based techniques with genuine human connection. We might use
            EMDR to process trauma, CBT to challenge unhelpful thoughts, or just have a
            real conversation about what's actually going on in your world.
          </p>
          <p>
            No judgment, no agenda, just curiosity about your experience and support for
            whatever comes up.

          I'm a therapist who specializes in helping individuals and couples create more safety, connection, and pleasure in their lives. My approach blends evidence-based techniques with genuine human connection, always centering your unique experience and needs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I specialize in sex and relationship therapy, with an extensive background in sexual trauma, intimacy challenges, high-conflict couples, and family or relational discord. I've received in-depth training in sexual trauma and understand how deeply it can impact all areas of life. I'm especially passionate about the work that comes after trauma—supporting clients as they navigate healing and rediscover meaningful connection with themselves and others.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I take a holistic approach to therapy, recognizing the deep connection between the mind and body. Emotional pain and trauma often live in the body just as much as in the mind, and true healing requires us to gently tend to both. Together, we'll work to increase awareness, regulation, and resilience—helping you feel more grounded, connected, and whole.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I believe therapy should never be one-size-fits-all. That's why I'm cross-trained in a variety of evidence-based modalities, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and solution-focused therapy. I am also extensively trained in sex therapy and proudly practice from a sex-positive, affirming lens. In my work with couples, I integrate Gottman Method Couples Therapy to support deeper communication, trust, and intimacy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black leading-relaxed">
          Whether you're seeking healing, growth, or a stronger connection in your relationships, I'm here to help you move forward with compassion, clarity, and purpose.
